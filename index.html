<!-- 

Edit 1: Make big circles, like thought bubbles, to float across the screen. Vary the sizes based on importance and what you want people to click.

Make it a one page app style, perhaps multiple pages as long as it retains the bubble thoughts theme.

Think about clean, easily navigatable design.

Edit 2: The Bubbles should act like a NAV vertical side nav bar and the webpage should be sized that there is no need for scrolling past 1 page.

The content portion of the page should change without reloading the NAV as you click and hover over different things.

The Bubbles should be highlighted in a different (faded) color based on what page you are on.
